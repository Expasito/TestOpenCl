# TestOpenCl

TestOpenCl uses OpenCL to practie GPU acceleration. Will be used in other projects, but this is a testing ground and framework for getting other projects started up. This does require the SDK for OpenCL which was gathered from CUDA. This is very much a start to the project, but does have everything needed to start working.
